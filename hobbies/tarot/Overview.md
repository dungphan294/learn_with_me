## Introduction to Tarot
*Understand the basic of tarot and how best to use it.*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
| While traditionally tarot has been used for divination, a method to 'look into the future', our approach to tarot is a bit different. Our belief is that tarot is best used as a tool to allow the hidden voice of the self to speak. The cards are simply something tangible on which we can project our feelings and thoughts. <br><br> The symbols in the tarot are pulled from a deep history of human myth and archetypes, part of the world that psychologist Carl Gustav Jung would call the collective unconscious. Through telling and retelling, these archetypes have become embedded in the way that we interpret stories. Tarot allows us to put them together in various configurations so that we can see parallels between the stories within the cards and our own experiences. <br><br> The story you tell about yourself greatly influences the way you think about your future. Tarot is about helping you tell your story, finding facets you might have missed. <br><br> Obviously, this has limits, because we have limits. But the cards are often enough to provide a framework for you to begin the process of self-introspection and examine which aspects of your beliefs, attitudes and ideologies |  |

## The Meaning of Magic
*Understanding the relationship between magic and tarot.*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
| There is an ancient saying found in hermeticism, from which we can derive what magic really is. 'As above, so below.' What it means is roughly this: earth mirrors heaven, man mirrors god, the macrocosm mirrors the microcosm. 'The world' is simply a mirror of our own inner worlds. The boundary between these two is arbitrary - and self and other are really just one <br><br> If you understand yourself and your reality deeply, all paths of action will be clear. Hence the usefulness of the stories the tarot helps you tell! Magic becomes simply understanding what each symbol does in relationship to the others and the world, and interacting with them. This meaning of magic teaches us that once we shed our inner light on the story reality is telling, we can see all parts at play, and transform it. <br><br> So go tell yourself some stories, and re-write them the way you want them to be told. | |

## Major Arcana
*Taking the Fool's Journey.*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
|Each of the 22 major arcana is a stage in the journey from ignorance to wisdom, from the wide-eyed potential of the fool to unity and oneness with the world. These cards represent important stages of that journey. Having them in a reading indicates large scale, spiritual changes. <br><br> Because major arcana represent progression through life's stages, when you're looking at one, remember where it comes from and where it goes. Even if you get the Tower, remember that the Star comes after. <br><br> Don't ignore your intuition: even if each card has a general meaning, the imagery might speak directly to you. Let it talk to you with your own voice. Reading cards is all about weaving together universal aspects of the cards to tell a story. How did this card work alongside this other card?||

## Minor Arcana
*Understanding the four suits and day to day activities.*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
|The 56 minor arcana deal with more specific, and less big picture aspects of a reading. They let you look at the everyday details. Like the major arcana, each card of the minor arcana also describes a point along a journey, but this time, through their particular kingdom. <br><br> Each suit, which we will go over later, consists of numbered cards from the ace, to the ten. They also include 4 court cards, depicted as characters. These court cards can symbolize people in your life, or different aspects of yourself. They all play different roles, and have different relationships to their suit | |

## Reading Tarot Cards
*A short explanation of terminology and how to read tarot*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
|When reading the tarot, you start with having a question, or having an area of your life that you'd like more insight about. Ensure that your question is open-ended, and avoid simple yes or no questions. The tarot is best for explaining "why" and "how". <br><br> Next, choose a spread. Spreads are the layout and order of the tarot cards for a reading, and they are often geared towards answering certain types of questions. General spreads also exist that are flexible for almost any question. <br><br> After shuffling, draw each card, following the order and location of the spread. Each card answers one part of your question. Putting it all together, you'll have a comprehensive answer. | |

## The Suit of Wands
*Creativity, passion, inspiration, willpower and drive*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
| Associated with the element of fire, the suit of wands represents passion, inspiration and willpower. The wands imbue their users with primal energy, for it is through them that the cycle of creation can begin. Because of their ability to bring energy into any situation, they are also associated with action, ambition and making plans. <br><br> At their worst, they can refer to situations that are filled with recklessness and lack of direction. As you follow the journey within the wands, you'll come across these themes again and again.| |

## The Suit of Cups
*Emotions, relationships, love, intuition and habits*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
|The suit of cups rules over all that is associated with emotions, the unconscious, creativity, and intuition. They frequently talk about relationships, whether romantic or otherwise, and one's imagination and inner world. They are associated with the element of water, which becomes a frequent visual theme within this suit. <br><br> At their worst, the cups suit is fret with uncontrolled feelings, fantasy, and a disconnect with one's inner voice. ||

## The Suit of Swords
*Intellect, logic, communication, conflict and analysis* 
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
| The swords is the suit of intelligence, logic, truth, ambition, conflict and communication. It is associated with the element of air. In readings, these cards focus on the faculty and power of intellect, which like the swords themselves, are double-edged. This can be used for both good or evil, to help and to harm, and our greatest conflicts usually come from this delicate balance. <br><br> At their worst, the swords can be abusive, harsh, and lack empathy | |

## The Suit of Pentacles
*Resources, finances, health, manifestation and material matters*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
|The pentacles is the suit of all things worldly and material. Though we will immediately think of the pentacles as relating to financial matters, we also can understand them as being associated with security, stability, nature, health, and prosperity. <br><br> The pentacles are of earth element. When we see pentacles show up in a reading, they are usually concerned with your long term future, career, generosity, your household, business investments and your feelings of sensuality. <br><br> The negative side of the pentacles show up as greed, jealousy, miserliness, and unbridled ambition at the cost of all else. | |

## Reversed Tarot Cards
*Deficiencies and extremes*
| English Version | Vietnamese Version |
|---|---|
|Now that you understand the basics of each tarot card, you're ready to learn about reversals. Consider that all tarot cards, like us humans, have a light and a shadow. The strengths of the cards usually exist in its upright when the archetype of that card is balanced, while the weaknesses of the cards appear when that original energy goes to extremes, or is deficient. <br><br> Consider the Fool. Upright, they are represented by potential, fresh energy and innocence. This is the balanced archetype. Reversed, when the Fool is deficient, they can be stale, dull, stagnant. When the Fool goes to extremes, they may be careless, or unable to ever complete what they start. <br><br> Finally not everyone uses reversals. You as the reader will choose whether you want to use them or not. You can adjust this in the app as well! Head to your profile tab to change the setting ||
